    "# Early time series classification with sktime\n",
    "\n",
    "Early time series classification (eTSC) is the problem of classifying a time series after as few measurements as possible with the highest possible accuracy. The most critical issue of any eTSC method is to decide when enough data of a time series has been seen to take a decision: Waiting for more data points usually makes the classification problem easier but delays the time in which a classification is made; in contrast, earlier classification has to cope with less input data, often leading to inferior accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives a quick guide to get you started with running eTSC algorithms in sktime.\n",
